# 1. Introduction
A Mesh Topology is a network structure in which every networking device is connected directly to every other device. It provides multiple communication paths, ensuring high reliability and uninterrupted communication.
Mesh topology is commonly used in communication systems because it provides:
High Reliability 
Fault Tolerance 
Better Security 
Multiple Communication Paths 
Fast Data Transmission 
It is widely used in:
Banking systems 
Military communication 
Telecommunication networks 
Data centers 
Enterprise networks 
# 2. Concept of Mesh Topology
In mesh topology:
Every switch or node is directly connected to all other switches. 
Multiple communication paths are available. 
Failure of one connection does not affect the entire network. 
Data can travel through alternate routes. 
There are two types of mesh topology:
Full Mesh Topology 
Partial Mesh Topology 
In this project, a Full Mesh Topology is implemented using switches and PCs.

# 5. Components Required
Component	Quantity	Purpose
PCs	6	End Devices
Switches	6	Network Communication
Copper Straight Through Cable	6	PC-to-Switch Connection
Copper Cross-Over Cable	Multiple	Switch-to-Switch Connection
Cisco Packet Tracer	1	Network Simulation

# 6. Working Principle
1.Each PC sends data to its connected switch. 
2.The switch checks the destination address. 
3.Data is forwarded directly through mesh links. 
4.Multiple paths are available for transmission. 
5.If one link fails, another path is used automatically. 
6.The destination switch forwards data to the target PC. 

# 7. Example Scenario
Suppose:
PC0 wants to send data to PC5.
Data Flow:
PC0 → Switch0 → Switch5 → PC5
Alternative paths may also be used if one connection fails.
This demonstrates reliable communication using mesh topology.
